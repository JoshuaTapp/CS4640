            <h3>Howdy Stranger, let me introduce myself.</h3>
            <p> 
                Before my time at <a href="virginia.edu">UVA</a> I was a simple blue collar worker. I started my career as a entry level worker at Amazon's RDU5 
                sort center in Durham, NC. I quickly was promoted up and took a job as a Logistic Specialist in Richmond, VA. After two winters not seeing my family
                and wondering if this career track was what I wanted, I started taking classes at <a href="http://www.jtcc.edu">John Tyler Community College</a> while I was
                working nights at Amazon. 
            </p>
            <p> years went by and I graduated in the top 1% of all students in 2020. I was accepted into the University of Virginia that same year
                and began my studies in computer science at <a href="http://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science">the School of Engineering and Applied Science at UVA</a>.
                My studies at UVA have been rewarding, with so many interesting subjects to learn. My dedication to my studies has not changed. As of Spring 2022, my GPA is <b>3.953</b>
                and will remain high until my graduation. 
            </p>
            <p>I am currently seeking internships for Summer 2022. <a href="mailto:jct7bm@virginia.edu">Please contact me by email for job opportunities.</a> </p>
